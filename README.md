# List of Frequently used scripts

A nice thing to have is a .bashrc. Just copy the bashrc (without the dot) to your dotted .bashrc.


## startup.sh

Check the initial configuration of a linux host. For instance:

- Which shell I am using
- Which system
- Update the bashrc with some FUT (Frequently Used Things)


## Generic

- check-for-param.sh

Check the existence of parameters.

- clip.sh [requires xclip, xdotool]

Very useful. Copy a signature to the clipboard, and paste it anywhere.

- prompt-dialog.sh

Visualize a dialog where you can input text. This may be used as a variable.
